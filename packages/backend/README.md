Crossauth common
================

Copyright (c) 2026 Matthew Baker

Crossauth is a cross platform package for authentication.
It has a Typescript version and soon also a Python and
Scala/Java version.  At the moment it is not ready for
public use, though the Typescript version is ready to
be used by authorized developers.

This is the backend package on which the framework-specific
packages depend.
