This shows how to implement each of the OAuth flows from the client side.   

It shows how to require a user to log in first as well as how to use it without 
a local user account.

To get this demo working, you first need to start the `sveltekitserverexample`
example as this client connects to it.

For more details, see the `README.md` at the top of this repo.
