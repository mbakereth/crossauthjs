# Crossauth.js

Crossauth is a package for authentication and authorization using username/password, LDAP and OAuth2.  It has two components, each can be used without the other: server for the backend and client for the frontend.  

There is also a Python package (in a separate repository) that, it is planned wil provide identical functionality as the server-side in this package.

This package is very much in alpha and so far has been used in one project only.
Being alpha, the API is subject to change without warning.
