# Crossauth.js

Crossauth is a package for authentication and authorization using username/password, LDAP and OAuth2.  It has two components, each can be used without the other: server for the backend and client for the frontend.  

There is also a Python package (in a separate repository) that, it is planned wil provide identical functionality as the server-side in this package.
